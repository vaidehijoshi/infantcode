Game: "Friends" Rock, Paper, Scissors
==========

If you're anything like me, you're a huge fan of the T.V. show, "Friends".

This game is a based on an episode from "Friends" (Season 10, Episode 8), where Rachel, Phoebe, Joey, and Ross play "Rock, Paper, Scissors" to decide who will go inside for Thanksgiving dinner first. Of course, you can bet that this isn't your typical game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors".
