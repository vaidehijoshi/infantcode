NOTE: This is an experiment as I take my first baby steps in coding. Code mostly riffs off of exercises completed in online coding courses in an attempt to make them my own!

Game: "Friends" Rock, Paper, Scissors
==========

If you're anything like me, you're a huge fan of the T.V. show, "Friends".

This game is a based on an episode from "Friends" (Season 10, Episode 8), where Rachel, Phoebe, Joey, and Ross play "Rock, Paper, Scissors" to decide who will go inside for Thanksgiving dinner first. Of course, you can bet that this isn't your typical game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors". 

Watch this YouTube clip to see what kind of game you're about to play!: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_xH__mg03w


Game: "Friends" Thanksgiving Potatoes
==========

You could always count on the Thanksgiving episode from "Friends" to be the best one of the season.

This switch statement is a based on the first Thanksgiving episode from "Friends" (Season 1, Episode 9), where Monica has to make three types of mashed potatoes--mashed, with lumps, and tater tots--to accomodate everyone's Thanksgiving potato requests. I've also included candied yams from Brad Pitt's cameo (Season 8, Episode 9), and an English Trifle from Rachel's one attempt at cooking on Thanksgiving (Season 6, Episode 9).

Maybe this will help you decide what kind of potatoes you want to make this Thanksgiving. Or maybe you'll just get stuck watching YouTube videos of old "Friends" Thanksgiving episodes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaLaPEnjeqY
